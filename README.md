## Description
    This application was designed to be a simple note taker.  You can add notes of things you would like to be reminded of or things that need to be done.  Notes can be saved and reviewed at a later date.  Once those items are done or completed, the saved note can be deleted and additional notes can be added at anytime.
    
## Installation Instructions 
    There are no installation instructions required.  The note is access via the web on a computer or mobile device.

## Usage
    The application can be used to record things that need to be completed (to-do's) or track reminders.  Once a note is entered it can be saved and will appear on a list of saved notes on the left.  Saved notes can be called back to the main applicaton on the right to be reviewed or updated.  Saved notes can also be deleted once they are completed or no longer required.  Additonal notes can be added once you land on the note taker page or by clicking the pen if you are currently reviewing an existing note.
